# Contexts
This directory contains the contexts that will be used for the **GRACED** european project.

It may not be the best way to define the contexts (i.e. on contexts for all pilots, which are using different entities), but this only represents a first draft.

Most of the entities used are FIWARE standard entities. Therefore, up for now the `graced.jsonld` file is empty. There could be additions of non standard entities later.
