# Contexts
This directory contains the contexts that will be used for the **GRACED** european project (*This is a separate repo from the main GRACED repo, as the main repo is private, therefore contexts cannot be accessed*).

This repo will likely be merged with the **ngsild-api-data-models** repo.

It may not be the best way to define the contexts (i.e. one contexts for all pilots, which are using different entities), but this only represents a first draft.

Most of the entities used are FIWARE standard entities. Therefore, up for now the `graced.jsonld` file is empty. There could be additions of non standard entities later.
